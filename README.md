# ORF-Assembler

This is a repository for designing combinatorial ssDNA libraries for pooled ORF assays. These can be amplified and assembled into dsDNA libraries by golden gate cloning  for pooled overexpression screens. Input sequences are split so that they are flanked by high fidelity 4 bp overhangs. The number of parts a sequence is split into is defined by the user (e.g. Twist can synthesise up to 300 bp ssDNA pools). 

## TO DO: 
1. Add scripts to append constant regions required for PCR amplification and cloning
2. Add Barcodes and append constant regions required for RNAseq
3. Add scripts for saturation mutagenesis of oligos
