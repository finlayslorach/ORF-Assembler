# ORF-Assembler

This is a repository for designing combinatorial ssDNA libraries. These can be amplified and assembled into dsDNA libraries for pooled overexpression screens by golden gate cloning. Each input sequence is split into smaller parts as defined by the user (e.g. Twist can synthesis up to 300 bp ssDNA pools). Split sites are chosen so that each part is flanked by 4 bp overhangs, which have been validated as high fidelity T4 ligation sequences. 

## TO DO: 
1. Add scripts to append constant regions required for PCR amplification and cloning --> cloning
2. Add Barcodes and constant regions required for RNAseq --> pooled assays with RNAseq endpoint
3. Add scripts for saturation mutagenesis of oligos
